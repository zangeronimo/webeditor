##About de author
Hello, I'm Luciano Zangeronimo from Brazil, I'm 39 and I'm passionate about technology.

##A little of history
I had used this project WEBEditor to working for years, since 2006 when I make the first version.
The original version did made with PHP.
During years I had worked only with PHP (3, 4, 5, 7) but on 2013 I stopped my job and moved to a little farm, when I'm started a creation of Goats, yes, Goats.
In the year 2017 I had decided stop with the Goats, I have sold all, not kill them. =)
Since this day, I started my studies again, but, I had decided not using PHP more, and has started study Golang.
I have studied Golang for a year when I started working at Splice, on your P&D laboratory, to work with Golang, but... I work there yet, but, I do everything, minus like Develop, like I wanted.
Today I changed my mind, I like to know all process, not only Development, soI study differents technologies like Javascript, UX, Finance, Administration, Database, Pattern and, of course, English, today English is my hard bigger problem, I'm working hard to improve them.

##Why now on github?
I had decided using github to show my work, and, I have a dream to help people in your journeys.
